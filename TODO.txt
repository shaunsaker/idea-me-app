TODOS
    Add Images as notes
        Would be great to have a loading indicator in the photo grid - there is a 1-2 second delay before seeing your photo
        Images errors
        Paths - using cache at the moment which will be an issue if they clear app data

    Look into setNotes on editIdea. Shouldn't this save?
    All continue buttons should only show if appropriate
    Cards across app
        Categories

    On all header closeX (where appropriate), modal: are you sure you want to go back? You will lose this information.
    Input height is not readjusting correctly
    Modal delete messages should be more descriptive, ie. are you... delete idea: Title?
    Categories page should display backButton if routed from add/editIdea
        Otherwise you can't go back and lose your idea
    If you navigate to other page after welcome before geolocation, geolocation does not come in
    Forgot password when user does not exist?
    Profile page has edit button BR corner
    Display loader when saving/editing/deleting?
